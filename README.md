# notmetoo
Not Me too is a website which focuses on removal of the stigma surrounding mental health.
The website has sections like self-harm, helplines, explore, burn it and the home page.
It helps in prevention of self-harm, encourages people to ask for help and also comes handy during panic attacks.
It also assits people with insomnia to fall asleep.
The user can write down their issues or problems without having to worry about their privacy.
Since the website doesn't have a backend, the texts typed in the burn it section are safe. Hence the user can feel free and let their guard down.
